## [ButterSTT](https://github.com/ButterscotchV/ButterSTT)

My open source speech to text program for VRChat! This is a passion project of mine built to provide a local free speech to text service that is fast.

## [Bingus Search](https://bingus.bscotch.ca/)

Bingus Search is a passion project of mine to assist with technical support, helping people find accurate information through a simple question-based search.

## [SlimeVR Firmware Tool](https://slimevr-firmware.bscotch.ca/)

I host a fork of the SlimeVR Firmware Tool for people to use as the original is no longer hosted or maintained. There is a version being developed to be integrated within the SlimeVR software, but as of writing, it is not yet released.

## [SlimeVR Testing Checklist](https://slimevr-testing.bscotch.ca/)

This is a simple checklist I made to help with testing SlimeVR!

## [SlimeVR Web GUI](https://slimevr-gui.bscotch.ca/)

Originally made for use with Termux for standalone SlimeVR, now it's no longer needed and it's recommended you follow the [mobile setup guide](https://docs.slimevr.dev/tools/mobile-installation.html).
