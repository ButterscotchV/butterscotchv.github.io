# Introduction
For basic web safety, you should use a password manager to keep your passwords safe.

This guide will teach you how to make using a password manager as easy as using the password storage included within the browser.

## Don't store passwords with a browser
Don't store passwords in your browser's password storage! If you don't need to use a password or biometrics to unlock it, then any program on your computer will be able to access your passwords and steal them within a fraction of a second.

A password manager can work just as easily as your browser, but provide an additional layer of security for when a data breach occurs.

### Why not use my browser? (optional read)
When you store your passwords in your browser, they are stored in something called [DPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API). When stored within this database, the passwords are encrypted by a key that can be retrieved easily and automatically by any program.

Essentially what this means is that the passwords can be stolen **very** easily. The solution? Using a password manager instead can be just as convenient as using your browser but stores it encrypted using your own password, so any passwords stored will need *your* password to read it.

## What is a password manager? (optional read)
A password manager is an app or program that stores your passwords, secured with a password. Using a password to secure your password manager means that when a data breach occurs, it will take a lot of effort to get your passwords from it, giving you time to re-secure everything.

# What are my options?
Within the [options section](#options) is a list of password managers with a small snippet about each one. You can make your own judgement about what option you would like to use, but it's important to consider all of your options and what pros and cons they may have.

# What more can I do?
For a second layer of protection, you can use [multi-factor authentication](mfa.md).

# Options
## Bitwarden
Bitwarden is by far my favourite. It's free (with an *optional* subscription for a very low price), open source, and it's fairly easy to use.

## Enpass
Enpass is free and lets you store your passwords on your own computer instead of on the cloud, this allows you to choose who and what you trust with your data.

## 1Password
1Password requires a subscription to use but it's worth what you pay for it.

## LastPass
LastPass is only *partially* free. You are restricted to using only one device "type" with the free plan, either PC or mobile. If you wish to use this service, you should consider that LastPass has many issues in the company itself, you can look at the top of the beginners guide for more information.
