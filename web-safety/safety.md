# Web safety introduction
For basic web safety, you should use a password manager to keep your passwords safe.

This guide will teach you how to make using a password manager as easy as using the password store included within the browser.

# Why not use my browser? (optional read)
When you store your passwords in your browser, they are stored in something called [DPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API). When stored within this database, the passwords are encrypted by a key that can be retrieved easily and automatically by any program.

Essentially what this means is that the passwords can be stolen **very** easily. The solution? Using a password manager instead can be just as convenient as using your browser but stores it encrypted using your own password, so any passwords stored will need *your* password to read it.

# Options
## Bitwarden
Bitwarden is by far my favourite. It's free (with an *optional* subscription for a very low price), open source, and it's fairly easy to use.

## 1Password
1Password requires a subscription to use but it's worth what you pay for it.

## LastPass
LastPass is only *partially* free. You are restricted to using only one device "type" with the free plan, either PC or mobile.
